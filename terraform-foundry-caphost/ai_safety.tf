# AI Safety and Responsible AI configurations
# 
# NOTE: AI Safety policies are automatically managed by Azure AI Foundry
# The default RAI policies (Microsoft.Default and Microsoft.DefaultV2) are system-managed
# and cannot be created or modified via Terraform. They are automatically available
# when the AI Foundry account is created.
#
# Defender for AI settings are also automatically configured and should not be
# manually managed to avoid conflicts.
#
# If you need custom RAI policies, create them with unique names (not Microsoft.*)
# and configure them according to your specific requirements.
